# GUI
Description:
The Face Recognition Database project is designed to create a database of faces for identification purposes. The system allows the user to enter a name and priority level for each person in the database. Using facial recognition technology, the system opens the camera and captures 30 pictures of the person's face.

Key Features:

# 1-Face Capture: The system opens the camera and captures 30 pictures of a person's face for training purposes.
2-Face Recognition: If the user chooses the face recognition option, the system identifies how many faces have been trained in the database.
# 3-Exiting Program: If the user selects the exit option, the program terminates.
4-Database Training: The user can choose the database training option, which opens the robot's camera and detects faces. If the detected face matches a face in the database, the system welcomes the person.
# Otherwise, it detects the face as unknown and displays the information on the screen.

Technologies Used:
OpenCV: Employed for face detection and recognition.
Python: Programming language used for developing the project.
This project aims to provide an efficient and accurate facial recognition system for identification purposes, offering functionalities such as face capture, face recognition, and database training. By leveraging facial recognition technology, this system enhances security and identification processes.
